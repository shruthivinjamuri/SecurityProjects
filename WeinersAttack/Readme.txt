1)The arrays s[] and t[] should be in the return part of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

 -> Copy+Paste the code for the ExtendedEuclidean method on eclipse.
 -> Invoke the ExtendedEuclidean method from the main method as shown in the word document.
 -> Run the code and observe the output in the console.

2) Your RSA should contain encryption and decryption operations.
 -> Create a class RSA and copy+paste the entire code given in the word document.
 -> Run the code and observe the output in the console.

3) You program should demonstrate Wiener's attacks on RSA with small decryption exponent given in the lecture: finding d based on n and e.
4) An example of n and e satisfying Wiener’s condition is given in the HW. I have plugged in those values in the code.
 -> Create the class WeinersAttack and copy+paste the entire code given in the word document.
 -> Run the code and observe the output in the console.

All the main methods are clearly implemented to aid the apprpriate method invocations.
